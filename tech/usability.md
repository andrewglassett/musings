title: 'Why Usability?'

"Usability' sounds like a buzz word, and it gives us an almost religious sense of accomplishment. Yes, we are thinking about users. We aren't thinking about ourselves. We aren't thinking about our company first. In reality, usability is very much thinking about the company first, as people who are users quite literally are the reason that a company exists. I'm not talking about those companies that are too big to fail, usability becomes more important as the probability of failure and descruction goes up.

Improved usability increases success/revenue.

> Users find the right/relevant information.
> They will pay extra / engage more because their lives are easier
> In an ecommerce situation, sales obstacles are resolved
> Users are more informed and won't need as much support

Improved usability reduces costs

> Only spend time developing only functions customers want
> Detect and fix usability problems early in dev process
> Reduce risk of failure caused by minimize confusion
> Reduce or eliminate need for documentation

Three Priciples of Usability
> 1. Early and continual focus on users and their tasks
> 2. Empirical measurement of user behavior
> 3. Iterative Design

Waterfall based approach is focused on production.
> Good if you know what the problem is and how to fix it.
> Goals: functionality and stability

The Scope of Usability
----------------------
1. The Context of Use
2. The User Requirements
3. Design Solutions


#Building The Context of Use

> Get out of the building and meet our users
> User will adapt to our systems to work how they want to work


#Contextual Inquiry (Site Visit / Shadowing)
"I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours."
- Jerome K. Jerome

4 Steps of Contextual Inquiry
-----------------------------
1. Context - Go to user's environment (where the action is)
2. Partnership - People adopt a master-apprentice relationship (Treat the user as an expert)
3. Interpretation - Verify your assumptions and conclusions are correct after experience
4. Focus - I'm going to research how doctors use laptops so I can design a mobile experience

##TEST IN USER ENVIRONMENT (MAYBE EVEN DESIGN THERE TOO)
##I AM NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE

Some habits of Highly Effective Researchers
-------------------------------------------
1. Create a focus question for particular research session
2. Record the session (transcribe even)
3. Ask good questions
    - Focus on big picture
    - Describe a typical day in your office?
4. Take photographs
    - wide shot
    - mid shot (in office)
    - close up (showing interactions)
5. Take Great Notes
    - empathy map
6. Summarize observations immediately
    - fill out a form 10-15 minutes after interview
7. Analyze data
    - wall of post it notes full of mental models
    - create experience map (adaptive path)

##The gap between what people say and what they do is a design opportunity

#Personas
Building User Profiles
- Personas are helpful because they are contraining
- Short engaging summaries of key customer groups
- Ban "user", use "my friend" "my wife" or someone's name

Elements of Personas
+ Status
+ Photograph
+ Name
+ Quotation that capture the customer's key objective
+ Short narrative describing customer
+ List of key goals

After interviewing in person, make comparison that puts people in groups
Personas engage the design and development team

##Personas Help Us Avoid
1. Self referential design
2. Organisation centered design
3. Barnacle based design
4. Technology centered design


##Pitfalls of Personas
- Personas should reflect differences that really matter
    + Age
    + Gender
    + Demographics
- Dont have too many personas (21 interviews, 4 personas)
- Personas are based on research (if you dont have research, personas are meaningless)

##P.E.R.S.O.N.A.

1. *P*rimary research: Contextual interviews with real customers
2. *E*mpathy: Include a name, photograph and product relavent narrative
3. *R*ealistic: Appear realistic to people who deal with customers day to day
4. *S*ingular: Is it unique, having little in common with other personas?
5. *O*bjectives: Include product relevant high-level goals and key goal quote?
6. *N*umber: Are there few enough to make design decisions tractable
7. *A*pplicable: Can dev team user persona to make design decisions?

##Identifying Red Routes
- Critical "user journeys" that must be kept clear
- Focus on users needs and most profitable scenarios and reduce choices
- Designs are often too complex
- Less important tasks can destroy value
    + Identify users' goals
    + Express the goals as user stories
    + Design software around user stories

#Design a vase - Product focused and isn't creative.
#VS
#Design a way for your best friend or girlfriend to enjoy flowers

> Red routes produce actionable results

> Red routes are channel-agnostic

Red routes for Expedia?
    Book a room
    Book a flight

#People approach tasks different based on context of use
    Book a romantic trip 
        Price doesnt matter
        Can I see the room (is is romantic enough)
        Can I get a flight that leaves at an appropriate time

    Book on a business trip
        Does the hotel have wi-fi?
        What are luggage requirements

#User stories (written on cards)
    +As a business traveller, I want to see hotels with a business center
     so I can work remotely

    +As a Tourist I want to see pictures of the bedrooms so I can have a  romantic weekend with my partner 

    +As a travel agent, I want to export my past bookings that I can invoice my clients

    +As a user, I want to cancel a reservation (generic user)

#How to test a user story
    Is it really a red route?
    It is specific and measurable?
    Does it describe a complete activity? (more than simple action)
    Does its describe what the user wants to do?(not how it's done)
