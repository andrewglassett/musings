    Close your eyes. In your minds eye design a vase for flowers. What does your vase look like? Is it curved? Does it have a thick base? Now smash the vase on the ground. Now, in the recessesses of that capable brain, think about an innovative way to display flowers. What are your flower displaying needs? Maybe you want them to hang from the ceiling or coming out from a wall. Maybe you want to create an updated version of potpurri

    This silly little example shows the difference between focusing on a PRODUCT vs focusing in the USER. If we focus on specific user needs, we can in turn be more creative in our approach and solve problems that actually need solving.

For the site:
#What were the business challenges?
This could be something as simple as a sentence or two that indicates what problem you were solving.

#What was your approach?
Surely you evaluated / tried things and settled on a solution…Note these down and the decision-making that went into how you came to your conclusions.

#What was that process like?
What were the lessons learned? What compromises were made and how did the effect the final product?

#What was the result?
When did you say ‘finished’? Was it when you handed the work off to the client or is it every two weeks when you track user engagement with a new app or game?

#How did you measure success / failure?
Surely not everything you work on is a smashing success. What did you use to evaluate the results of your labor? How does your boss, or bosses’ boss, know that what you worked on turned out to be a success for the company? How is it measured? Is there a percentage increase that is important to the business?

Simply thinking in these terms, and communicating this to those you are interviewing with / for, will help put you ahead of 99% of other candidates that roll in the door with shiny wireframes.

Try ditching the portfolio for once and focus everyone’s attention on you as a problem-solver, not a draftsman (or woman). You’ll be able to (re) invent yourself in a way where your value increases exponentially since you can solve business challenges and draw a straight line.
