Box Model
==============================

_You can't put democracy and freedom back into a box. -George W. Bush_

No, this collection of thoughts is not actually about the beautiful CSS box model spec (although I'm sure there are some correlations). This article is about my perspective on the psychological principle of being in a box, creatively. The idea stems from the recent influx of tools for creating prototypes and (YIKES) people putting code into production from GUI interfaces.

Let me get it out of the way that I have been designing things in one form or another for fifteen years. First it was with sound (I even had a four track recorder before I had a computer), then with words (as a Managing Editor for a punk magazine), then a short jaunt as a fashion creator which landed me in the world of computer aided graphics. 

A few topics I am looking to cover:

> Are limitations good for you?
> Are we working against limitations or striving because of them
> Box-sizing: border-box changes


I'm no CSS expert, but part of my working day is using CSS to create functional wireframes for clients. In my opinion it is the best way to communicate web design to clients. My dream scenario would be so badass at creating these wireframes that while conferencing with clients I could make changes in real time to the wireframes and have them work together. I think this is a box:

create wireframes > send to client > client reviews > conference with client > make notes > update wireframes > send to client  etc

I feel like it should actually be:

create functional wireframes > review & edit with client
