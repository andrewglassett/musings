Box Model
==============================

_You can't put democracy and freedom back into a box. -George W. Bush_

No, this collection of thoughts is not actually about the beautiful CSS box model attribute (although I'm sure there are some correlations). This article is about my perspective on the psychological principle of being in a box, creatively. The idea stems from the recent influx of tools for creating prototypes and (YIKES) people putting code into production from GUI interfaces.

Let me get it out of the way that I have been designing things in one form or another for fifteen years. First it was with sound (I even had a four track recorder before I had a computer), then with words (as a Managing Editor for a punk magazine), then a short jaunt as a fashion creator which landed me in the world of computer aided graphics. 

A few topics I am looking to cover:

> What limitations are good for you
> Are we working against limitations or striving because of them
> Is it better to have all the options, or be forced to follow set of guidelines?
