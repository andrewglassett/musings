Reset Food
==========

I'm obsessed with food, just like about everyone else I know. Through my travels I have learned that the food system in America may be hopelessly broken. At the risk of sounding like a nut job, here is how I see it.

> Corporations control food systems.
> Corporations love money, and do whatever they need to make more of it.
> Quantity is the only way to make money.
> Food becomes too homogenous.
> Mono culture causes vast problems in nature and in health
